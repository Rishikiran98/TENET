"""Core data types for the memory subsystem, after the event-log refactor.

The old single ``MemoryRecord`` splits along the raw/derived seam the
architecture demands (§4):

- ``RawRecord`` — the canonical source of truth. It *is* the content of a
  ``memory.raw.appended`` event: exact bytes ingested, never mutated, with a
  content hash recorded at ingest. Non-disposable.
- ``ContextRecord`` — a *derived projection* of a raw record produced by the
  contextualizer. Disposable and rebuildable; it is the only tier retrieval
  touches. It carries its provenance (``raw_id``, ``raw_content_hash``,
  ``contextualizer_version``) as fields, not as a slogan.

``RetrievalResult`` pairs a context record with its similarity score, keeping
provenance attached all the way to the caller.
